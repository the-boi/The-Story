He be mindin’ his own business but then he be shot by a white guy ‘cause he black. He be rushed to the hospital and he didn’t die.</p> 
<p style="color:#191970;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;text-align:center,">He be saved by the black doctors ONLY. They the only people that be carin’ ‘cause they be black. Even the ambulance driver be black. The little boi’s friends all be black.</p>
